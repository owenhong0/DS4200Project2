          <h2>Exploratory Analysis:</h2>
          <p>
            The analysis of the dataset reveals insightful trends across various music genres based on key attributes.
            Popularity distributions show that most songs are centered around the 70s, with genres like Latino and
            Reggaeton having three tracks each in the highest popularity range, while Pop and Dance stand out with one
            song rated 100 for popularity. Regarding song duration, most tracks fall within the 2 minutes 40 seconds to
            4 minutes range, with Alternative, Alt-Rock, Metal, and Rock having longer songs, some reaching up to 9
            minutes, while Indie and Indie Pop feature shorter songs, often under a minute. When examining danceability,
            the data reveals a generally normal distribution, with genres like Alternative and Alt-Rock showing lower
            danceability scores, while Reggaeton and Latino music showcase the most danceable tracks, peaking around
            scores of 70-80. For energy, genres like Rock, Metal, Indie, and Alternative show right-skewed distributions
            with most songs exceeding 70 in energy, while Indie music includes 15 tracks with a perfect score of 100.
            Lastly, tempo trends indicate that Latino and Reggaeton music commonly have a tempo around 95 BPM, while
            EDM, House, and Electro music are centered around 120-130 BPM, highlighting distinct rhythmic patterns
            across genres.

          <h2>Explanatory Analysis:</h2>
          <p>
            These genre suggest that the geographic and cultural distributions of Spotify users may impact their
            popularity ratings . Latino and reggaeton genres having multiple high rated scores for songs may be directly
            impacted by the number of people who listen to that genre. This means both there are large amounts of
            Spanish speaking users who listen to that genre but also that Spotify grouping all of those songs together
            may force a lack of distribution and specificity within those genres. Trends in durations seem to be
            reasonable as most songs fall near the 3 minute mark that usually dominates the average lengths of songs
            that users are used to listening to. The longer and shorter songs can represent the intro tracks to albums
            or unique tracks in albums that users may usually not listen to but are included in popular albums. For
            danceability, energy, and tempo, the data reflects reasonable suggestions that edm and house music has more
            energy but less danceable while latino and reggaeton offers more groovy songs that may be slower.

          <h2>Exploratory Analysis:</h2>
          <p>
            This interactive scatter plot illustrates diverse relationships across pairs of features. For loudness and
            energy, there is a strong positive relationship between loudness and energy across all genres. As loudness
            increases (approaching 0 dBFS), energy levels tend to rise as well, forming a dense upward-sloping cluster.
            The concentration of data points in the upper right quadrant confirms that many tracks are both loud and
            energetic. Although genres overlap considerably, some patterns emerge: genres like metal, EDM, and rock tend
            to occupy the louder and more energetic end of the spectrum, while more mellow genres like indie and
            indie-pop are scattered toward the lower left. The wide dispersion at lower loudness levels shows that
            quieter songs tend to vary more in energy, while louder tracks are consistently high in energy.
          </p>

          <h2>Explanatory Analysis:</h2>
          <p>
            For loudness and energy, this visualization supports the idea that these features are deeply intertwined,
            particularly in genres designed to be physically stimulating, like metal, EDM, and reggaeton. However, the
            overlap of genres suggests that loudness and energy alone do not define genre boundaries. This raises the
            question of whether genres are better differentiated by combining multiple features (e.g., valence,
            danceability). The spread of quieter songs with a wide energy range—especially in indie and pop—also
            suggests that some genres allow more dynamic diversity. Another potential hypothesis emerging here is that
            songs with moderate loudness but high energy might leverage different production techniques (e.g., rhythmic
            drive or instrumentation) to feel intense without being overly loud. This could be a useful insight for
            producers aiming to balance impact with listening comfort.

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <p>
        This interactive scatter plot allows users to explore relationships between various song features across
        genres.
        Use the dropdown controls to select different features for the X and Y axes and observe how genres cluster
        based on these features.
      </p>
      <p>
        The visualization highlights trends and correlations that may indicate which factors contribute to a song’s
        popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
        **Note: We chose loudness and energy as areas to analyze as trends in other features were very similar to those
        in the next visualization.
        More analysis on those features are offered there.

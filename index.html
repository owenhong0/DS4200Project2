      <h1> Motivation </h1>
      <p>
        Understanding what drives a song’s popularity is useful information for artists, producers, and others in the
        music industry, with widely-used music streaming platforms being a reliable source of data on how listeners
        engage with songs. Using a snapshot of Spotify data from 2022, this project investigates two key questions: (1)
        what song characteristics—such as duration, energy, and tempo—define popular music genres, and (2) how those
        characteristics and genres relate to a song’s popularity. By analyzing these factors, we aim to uncover trends
        in popular genres and songs, offering insights into listener preferences and music consumption on streaming
        platforms.

      <h1> Data </h1>
      <p>
        The data originates from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset/"> Kaggle</a> and is a snapshot in time of the most popular songs on Spotify from October
        22nd, 2022. Representing over 125 different genres of music in CSV format, the dataset has 21 columns describing
        each track’s ID, popularity, duration, danceability, and other documented features. There are around 90,000
        unique track IDs in this dataset that corresponds to around 110,000 rows with around 30,000 unique artists to
        analyze. The file itself is 20 MB in size.

        The numerical attributes used in analysis are:
      </p>
        <li> A track’s popularity (0-100, where 100 is most popular). Mainly determined by the track’s total</li>
        <li> number of plays and how recent the plays are.</li>
        <li> Duration: The track duration in milliseconds.</li>
        <li> Danceability: How suitable a track is for dancing (0-1, where 1 is most danceable).</li>
        <li> Energy: How active and intense the track is (0-1, where 1 is highest energy).</li>
        <li> Loudness: The overall loudness of a track in decibels.</li>
        <li> Speechiness: How much a track uses spoken words (0-1, where 1 is entirely spoken words).</li>
        <li> Acousticness: How acoustic a track is (0-1, where 1 is entirely acoustic).</li>
        <li> Instrumentalness: How many vocals a track uses (0-1, where 1 is no vocal content).</li>
        <li> Liveness: How likely it was that a track was performed live (0-1, where 1 is performed live).</li>
        <li> Valence: How positive (happy, cheerful, etc.) the track sounds (0-1, where 1 is most positive).</li>
        <li> Tempo: The overall tempo of a track in beats per minute.</li>

      <h1> Summary </h1>
      <p>
        This project investigates how musical characteristics relate to genre and song popularity using Spotify data
        from 2022. Analysis reveals that some genres are characterized by distinct feature profiles—for example, metal
        having low danceability and high energy—and that some features are positively correlated, indicating shared
        characteristics among songs. Genre may influence popularity, as popularity is not evenly distributed across
        genres. However, musical features did not directly correlate with popularity, suggesting that other external
        factors may influence popularity, such as the artist's popularity and marketing.

        Future work could include additional variables to explore what external factors may influence popularity. In
        addition, because we used data that was a snapshot in time, there was no temporal component; therefore, time
        series data could be included to study how listener preferences have changed over time. Lastly, comparing
        results with those from other streaming platforms (Apple Music, YouTube, etc.) could test whether the observed
        patterns are Spotify-specific or more universal across music consumption.
